# Malloc

This project provides a simple memory management simulation in C. It demonstrates basic memory allocation and deallocation mechanisms using a fixed-size heap. The implementation also includes an additional functionality for tracking and merging memory blocks to optimize space utilization. The key features include memory allocation, memory deallocation, and merging contiguous free blocks to optimize memroy usage.
